# Chrona

A deterministic concurrent workflow execution engine built in Go from scratch.

Chrona is a **systems-level learning project** designed to implement and
deeply understand:

- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) execution
- Task dependency tracking via topological sort (Kahn's algorithm)
- Fixed-size goroutine pools with bounded backpressure
- Task lifecycle state machines
- Pluggable scheduling strategies (FIFO, Priority, Round-Robin)
- Crash recovery via Write-Ahead Logging
- Graceful shutdown with context cancellation
- Concurrency correctness: no races, no deadlocks, no goroutine leaks

Task lifecycle:

```
Pending ──► Ready ──► Running ──► Completed
                              ↘
                               Failed ──► Retrying ──► Ready
```

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Shutdown signal | `stopCh` channel (not `close(taskCh)`) | Sending to a closed channel panics in Go, even inside `select` |
| Submit guard | Two-phase `stopCh` non-blocking check | Prevents non-deterministic result when `taskCh` has space and `stopCh` is closed simultaneously |
| Result buffer | `cap = queueDepth + nWorkers` | Prevents workers blocking on result send while Shutdown waits on `wg.Wait()` |
| Task state | `sync.Mutex` per task | Guards a single field; channels would add unnecessary indirection |
| Dispatch queue | Bounded `chan *task.Task` | Natural backpressure — producer blocks, not buffers |
| Execution guarantee | At-least-once | Exactly-once requires 2PC; `TaskFunc` must be idempotent |
| Topo sort | Kahn's BFS | Produces parallel layers directly; no recursion/stack overflow risk |

---

## Concurrency Guarantees

- **No data races:** verified with `go test -race` on every commit
- **No deadlock:** strict lock ordering (dag.mu > task.mu); channels never held with locks
- **No goroutine leaks:** every goroutine has a clear exit condition via `ctx.Done()` or channel close
- **Panic isolation:** worker goroutines recover from panicking `TaskFunc`s and continue
